She’s on the cusp of gold when an unexpected pregnancy throws her future into chaos. Nathaniel Hart takes on the daunting project of restoring Whiskey Jack Ski Resort to be close to his young son, but with one failed marriage behind him, he avoids serious relationships. They might be virtual strangers with only a baby in common, but Nate is determined to be part of his child's life. Ilke didn't become a champion by ever backing down from a challenge, especially not one where her child's happiness and her own heart are on the line. When tragedy strikes, heartbreak draws them closer together. Nate discovers he’s more than ready for a bigger family and maybe, just maybe, Ilke will find the home that has eluded her all her life.",

It's a journey deep within, in a way that's respectful and non-invasive; a journey for which we will all pay a heavy price, even if you've waited for the smaller paperback edition. Ayoade argues for the canonisation of this brutal masterpiece, a film that celebrates capitalism in all its victimless glory; one we might imagine Donald Trump himself half-watching on his private jet's gold-plated flat screen while his other puffy eye scans the cabin for fresh, young prey.\"",

Eleven-year-old Diva is horrified (but not surprised) that her mother's new dream home is a bright pink castle-like house. But the pink palace is only the beginning of a series of new humiliations. While acting as a glitzy mermaid for her Mom's party planning business, Diva is spotted by some classmates who won’t let her live it down. When she works up the courage to audition for her new school's play, she's cast in a surprising (and ridiculous) role. But it’s when her family throws her a huge surprise birthday party that things really lurch toward disaster. How can Diva stay true to her introverted, under-the-radar self in an in-your-face, over-the-top world?",

No one, honey. The truth is, it hasn’t always been gorgeous for this beacon of positivity and joy. Before he stole our hearts as the grooming and self-care expert on Netflix’s hit show Queer Eye, Jonathan was growing up in a small Midwestern town that didn’t understand why he was so…over the top. From choreographed carpet figure skating routines to the unavoidable fact that he was Just. So. Gay., Jonathan was an easy target and endured years of judgement, ridicule and trauma - yet none of it crushed his uniquely effervescent spirit. Over the Top uncovers the pain and passion it took to end up becoming the model of self-love and acceptance that Jonathan is today. In this revelatory, raw, and rambunctious memoir, Jonathan shares never-before-told secrets and reveals sides of himself that the public has never seen. JVN fans may think they know the man behind the stiletto heels, the crop tops, and the iconic sayings, but there’s much more to him than meets the Queer Eye. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, and you’ll come away knowing that no matter how broken or lost you may be, you’re a Kelly Clarkson song, you’re strong, and you’ve got this.",

There was only one scrawled piece of paper on the desk so there was no mistaking the single command. It said: organize Christmas. Helen is finally finding her feet just in time for the looming festive season. Surrounded by family, friends and the finer things in life, Helen’s generous offer to organize Christmas for the neurotic Leoni soon snowballs into an unmanageable avalanche of tasks when her chaotic boss dumps his seasonal arrangements on her too. And with Julia heading towards a mind-boggling midlife crisis of her own, it looks as though Helen is well and truly stuffed! And so it begins, the season of good grief to all women . . .

Instead of the quiet precollege summer she expects, Anabelle makes some surprising discoveries about herself as she navigates romantic entanglements and changing friendships. Through shifting points of view in seven interconnected stories, we glimpse the limits of how well her friends really know Anabelle . . . and how little she grasps about the way they see her. With wry observations and quirky humor, critically acclaimed novelist Hillary Frank gives voice and depth to six unique characters whose stories intertwine to form a complete picture of one shared summer.",

Sophie Steele, twenty-two and fresh out of business school, thinks she has it all: beauty, an MBA, and a high-powered job at a hedge fund in New York City. But Sophie's about to uncover a whole new life – a life filled with beautiful people, exclusive parties, and tantalizingly hot sex – when she moves into her older sister Bella's fabulous Tribeca penthouse apartment. Bella Steele, a Penthouse Pet and Manhattan's hottest glamour model, can have her pick of rich, sexy guys eager to satisfy her every desire, and Sophie can't help but feel envious of her exciting, girl-about-town lifestyle. When her super-hot boss makes her an erotic offer she can't refuse, Sophie takes Bella's advice and starts to explore her wild side. Meanwhile, Bella's about to start some erotic experimenting of her own. She introduces Sophie and her best friend Maya Lin to Naked, the city's sexiest gym, where anything goes. It's there that Maya finds release through submission in an edgy, dark relationship with her boxing trainer, D, and all three girls let their passion take them over the top.",
